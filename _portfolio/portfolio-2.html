At the CENTER FOR COGNITIVE & SKILL ENHANCEMENT (CCSE) lab, my research topic was: "Application of Biomedical Signal Processing, Analysis, and Classification to Identify the Biomarkers of Stroke for Early Prediction and Post-Stroke Recovery."
My work centers on the intricate world of biomedical signals, seeking to harness their potential in the identification of crucial stroke biomarkers. These biomarkers hold the key to early prediction, offering a vital window of opportunity for intervention. By delving deep into the analysis of these signals, my research aims to develop innovative methods to predict strokes at their earliest stages, when interventions are most effective.
